# README

Welcome to the Allyship Corner backend repo! This serves as a Rails API for the Allyship Corner JavaScript application, the repository for which can be found here: https://github.com/jkellyphilly/allyship-corner.

This application is intended to be a community that provides users the ability to find events to support oppressed minority groups. Users can create new events, express their interest in current events, and comment on any event to bolster community relations.

This was built with Ruby v2.6.1.

## Installation

Fork and clone this repository down to your local environment, then run 'bundle install' to install all required gems from the Gemfile. Please note that the allyship-corner-backend folder is a sub-repository, and can be found here: https://github.com/jkellyphilly/allyship-corner-backend.

From your command line, navigate into the allyship-corner-backend folder and run `bundle install`. Upon successful installation, run `rails s` to start up the server.

From your command line, navigate into the allyship-corner-frontend folder and run `open index.html`. If you are using Google Chrome (recommended), open your developer console with CMD+OPTION+J. If you don't see any errors, then the first fetch request has been successful and the application is up and running.

## Usage

Sign up with a unique username (that doesn't yet exist in our database) and password, then watch as all events and corresponding comments are rendered on the page post-server call. Create an event, comment on existing events, or click on the "I'm interested!" button to update the attendee count and signal your interest.
